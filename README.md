# Multi-View-MRI-Approach-for-Classification-of-MGMT-Methylation-in-Glioblastoma-Patients

#Introduction

This is an implementation of the model used for MGMT Methylation in Glioblastoma Patients classification as described in our paper Multi View MRI Approach for Classification of MGMT Methylation in Glioblastoma Patients. The code for training, the Weights for trained models are provided. as well as provided Comparison source code.



The repository is divided into two folders. One for the source model that we used in the paper. The second for the comparison that we mentioned in the paper.
# Architecture 
Below we show our approch that we used in the paper.
