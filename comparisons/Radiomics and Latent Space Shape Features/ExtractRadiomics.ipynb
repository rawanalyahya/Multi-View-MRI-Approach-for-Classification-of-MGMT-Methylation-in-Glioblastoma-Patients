    "It should be noted that the authors of the nn-unet for brats segmentation paper referred to the brain tumor sub-regions as edema, enhancing tumor, and non-enhancing tumor, which they later described as being potentially inconsistent and subjective. However, it is clear from the context of their paper that the non-enhancing tumor label corresponds to the same sub-region that we have segmented as necrosis. Additionally, the brats2020 dataset uses the label necrosis/non-enhancing tumor for this same sub-region, further supporting the interchangeable use of these terms. Therefore, the present experiment's segmentation of the sub-regions into enhancing tumor, necrosis, and edema can still be used to extract radiomics features following the approach proposed by the nn-unet for brats segmentation paper, with the replacement of the non-enhancing tumor label with the necrosis label, without significantly affecting the overall results of the study."
